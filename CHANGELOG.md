* Reorganised code to separate classes into individual files - for example, to take all the separate Particle classes and move them into their own files to facilitate separating out the various parts of the Ringmind structure so that they are independent.
* Added new javadoc comments in an effort to help to understand the code.
* A number of variables have been renamed to improve readability.
